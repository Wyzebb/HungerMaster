This is a simple plugin to add a `/food` command with options

- There are 3 subcommands: `add`, `sub` and `set` to give different options for adding, subtracting and setting food, rather than just the typical `set` provided by most feed plugins.
<br /><br />
- Usage: `/food <add/sub/set> <amount> [target]`
- Permission: `hungermaster.command`
<br /><br />
- Tab autocomplete has been implemented
